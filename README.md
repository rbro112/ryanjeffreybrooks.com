My personal webpage. Used to experiment with Kotlin/JS and Compose-web primarily, but also to host my talks, blog posts and musings.

Available publicly at [ryanjeffreybrooks.com](https://ryanjeffreybrooks.com). Uses a serverless container, so takes about 2s for spin up time. (I'll be working on this)
